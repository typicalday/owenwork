/**
 * oweflow — a generic dataflow workflow engine.
 *
 * Loops owe and consume artifacts; a loop's eligibility to run is a pure
 * function of artifact state (debts + dependency satisfaction), not a status
 * enum. Rejection carries a reason thread; a forward cascade keeps the graph
 * honest ("an artifact is green only while every artifact it consumed is
 * green"); a commit-fingerprint CAS makes concurrent advancement safe.
 *
 * This is the public API. The engine is domain-neutral: a *wiring* (a set of
 * workflow definitions + a worker that executes orders) layers a concrete
 * process — software delivery, research, triage — on top of it.
