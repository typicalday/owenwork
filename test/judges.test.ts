/**
 * §24 — artifact judges (docs/proposals/artifact-judge.md). End-to-end engine
 * coverage for the `judges:` feature: a producer step's `produces` entry
 * declares one or more judges; the producer's `green` commit lands the
 * artifact `submitted` instead of `green`; each judge is a synthesized
 * StepDef that fires through the *normal* eligibility/claim/order pipeline
 * (§7.1) and renders its verdict via the existing `green`/`reject` verbs
 * against the judged stem (Q2).
 *
 * Fixture: `researcher` produces `report`, gated by two judges —
 * `completeness` and `rigor` — mirroring the proposal's §5 example.
